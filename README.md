This mini program downloads a list of many files that exist in a site. They are all in the same folder so it is easy to download it.

The 'checkmissing.py' program checks for all missing files from the original list and saves them to a new list for further processing.

The 'browserBasedDownloader.py' program opens a tab in the browser of your choice, in case you wish to download the files from there.

The 'main.py' downloads the files using Python, by iterating through the file list.
