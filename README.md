This mini program downloaded a list of many files that existed in a site. They were all in the same folder so it was easy to download them.

The 'checkmissing.py' program checks for all missing files from the original list and saves them to a new list for further processing.

The 'browserBasedDownloader.py' program opens a tab in the browser of your choice, in case you wish to download the files from there.
(In case you want to donwload using multiple IPs and you don't have a VPN/Proxy, you can use a browser's VPN for your purposes.)

The 'main.py' downloads the files using Python, by iterating through the file list.

NOTE : This is a general idea that I used for my research purposes, it is by no means a "downloader" program.
